**MicroService Website Using NodeJS and TypeScript**
_
_This Website is essentially an authetication provided well managed Microservices Project where I've Combined MERN Stack where I have used both MongoDB as well as MySQL for database, and then used Cloud of RabbitMQ for inter-communication of both servers! ____
The admin route has mainly the responsibility of essentially managing the products by the sellers and evaluation of the products by health organizations and the main app is for the users, liking, purchasing, favoritiing the products and I have used DataTables of JS when required and lazy loading search and sort where required
